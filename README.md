# Hello World! 🌍 I'm Hamza Ben Allal!

This is my old GitHub account where I learned, experimented, and grew as a developer. Here you can see my journey from the beginning.

Although the projects here may not be very structured and organized, they serve as a testament to my learning process and the steps I've taken to become the developer I am today.

Projects included in this account:

📚 **UPFCalendar**: An earlier version of a university calendar app, which is still operational. This project was a stepping stone to further app development ventures.

📱 **Unibias App**: An app I developed aimed at providing a streamlined university calendar. Although the project is now closed due to information policies, it served as a valuable experience in app development and policy navigation.

📊 **PostgreSQL Table Transformation**: Here, I worked on transforming PostgreSQL tables into a visual diagram. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of database structures and further improved my skills in SQL.

🚀 **SpaceShip Game**(ProyectoDAW): A small video game where I learnt how to handle servers with real-time serving data using sockets. It was a fun and interactive way to understand server handling and real-time data management.
